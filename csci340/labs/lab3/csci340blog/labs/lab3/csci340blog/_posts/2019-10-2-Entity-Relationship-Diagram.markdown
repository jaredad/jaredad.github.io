To start I would say this ER Diagram was more difficult than I thought it would be. There is a lot of planning that needs to be done when thinking about what your database should look like. The assumptions I made in my diagram was that I assumed these databases were stored on the auction company website, so all the information would be stored there for them. I also assumed the 5% that the company gets would be handled in code and not in the database necessarily. I did not feel that there was much information about the auction company that justified a table in the schema. My implementation, as seen below, is quite simple and perhaps could be more complex. I just wanted to make sure the relationships between each table made sense and wouldn't cause major database issues. I believe I have managed to avoid any lists inside a column, as well as making sure only primary keys are shared as foreign keys from table to table. My draw.io is less sensible than my vertabelo diagram because I was still trying to figure out what to do when I was working on the draw.io schema.
