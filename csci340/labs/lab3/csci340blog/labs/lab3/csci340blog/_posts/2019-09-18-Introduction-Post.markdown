I found the tutorials given by Dr. Goadrich were very helpful in getting my Jekyll blog up and running. I had some difficulties when I tried to create my blog, because I needed to install extra gems to start the local server:


* [jekyll gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll/versions/3.8.5)
* [tzinfo gem](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/file/README.md)
* [wdm gem](https://pekalicious.github.io/jekyll/2019/01/06/02-could-not-find-wdm.html)


 I also had to learn some syntax things in git bash and gitkraken, which took a little bit of time to figure out. I spaced my project over the course of a few days, implementing a bit at a time. I am looking forward to seeing how we use this blog in the course. I am happy that I was able to create something that anyone can access online for free.
