There is a lot of planning that needs to be done when thinking about what your database should look like. The assumptions I made in my diagram was that I assumed these databases were stored on the auction company website, so all the information would be stored there for them. I also assumed the 5% that the company gets would be handled in code and not in the database necessarily. I did not feel that there was much information about the auction company that justified a table in the schema. My implementation, as seen below, is quite simple and perhaps could be more complex. I just wanted to make sure the relationships between each table made sense and wouldn’t cause major database issues. I believe I have managed to avoid any lists inside a column, as well as making sure only primary keys are shared as foreign keys from table to table. My draw.io is less sensible than my vertabelo diagram because I was still trying to figure out what to do when I was working on the draw.io schema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this lab to be the most difficult we have had thus far, and I’m glad to be finished with it. It was neat to see the end result of having a new theme for my jekyll blog. I have never worked with Jekyll blogs so everything about this lab was new to me. I’m looking forward to seeing what more we will do with the blogs. Here are a few links that I used for this project:&lt;/p&gt;

I had some difficulties when I tried to create my blog, because I needed to install extra gems to start the local server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll/versions/3.8.5&quot;&gt;jekyll gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/file/README.md&quot;&gt;tzinfo gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pekalicious.github.io/jekyll/2019/01/06/02-could-not-find-wdm.html&quot;&gt;wdm gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had to learn some syntax things in git bash and gitkraken, which took a little bit of time to figure out. I spaced my project over the course of a few days, implementing a bit at a time. I am looking forward to seeing how we use this blog in the course. I am happy that I was able to create something that anyone can access online for free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I found the tutorials given by Dr. Goadrich were very helpful in getting my Jekyll blog up and running.
