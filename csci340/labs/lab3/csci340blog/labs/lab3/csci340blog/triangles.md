I love triangles! Triangles are, in my opinion, the best shape closely followed by the circle. Here are some fun facts about triangles:

* Triangles are polygons with the least possible number of sides (3).
* The three internal angles of a triangle always add to 180 degrees.
* Triangle shapes are often used in construction because of their great strength.
* Triangles are an abstraction that we base a lot of our knowledge on; however, as far as we can tell triangles do not actually exist. This issue is more important than it may seem on the surface. Why are such mathematical concepts so useful in explaining our world, yet do not actually exist in the realm in which we experience.
