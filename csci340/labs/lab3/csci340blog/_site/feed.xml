I found this lab to be the most difficult we have had thus far, and I’m glad to be finished with it. It was neat to see the end result of having a new theme for my jekyll blog. I have never worked with Jekyll blogs so everything about this lab was new to me. I’m looking forward to seeing what more we will do with the blogs. Here are a few links that I used for this project:&lt;/p&gt;

I had some difficulties when I tried to create my blog, because I needed to install extra gems to start the local server:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rubygems.org/gems/jekyll/versions/3.8.5&quot;&gt;jekyll gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/tzinfo/file/README.md&quot;&gt;tzinfo gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pekalicious.github.io/jekyll/2019/01/06/02-could-not-find-wdm.html&quot;&gt;wdm gem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had to learn some syntax things in git bash and gitkraken, which took a little bit of time to figure out. I spaced my project over the course of a few days, implementing a bit at a time. I am looking forward to seeing how we use this blog in the course. I am happy that I was able to create something that anyone can access online for free.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I found the tutorials given by Dr. Goadrich were very helpful in getting my Jekyll blog up and running.
